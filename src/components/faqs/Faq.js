We can think of it as a hypergraphâ€”or, in simple cases, a graph. When we apply simple transformation rules over and over again, we can get something that looks really complicated. Now, if we ignore all matter in the universe, our universe is basically a big chunk of space and that can be a whole bunch of what are essentially abstract points, abstractly connected together. So, it is possible that there is an actual rule that represents our universe. The Notable Universe Models is a collection of Wolfram models exhibiting interesting properties, studied under the scope of the Wolfram Physics Project with the hope of finding the rule that represents our universe.</p>

Such data structure, or ledger, keeps immutable records of financial payment and transaction details, created assets, or smart contract deals.<br/><br/>As a blockchain stores data in a decentralized manner, it is independent of centralized, controlling entities, or middlemen. This provides enhanced transparency of data storage and its management. An important feature of blockchain is that it stores records immutably, which means that they cannot be changed, forged, or deleted.<br/><br/>Blockchains not only provide an immutable and secure database but also act as a functional environment to transact funds, create digital currencies, and process complex deals using digital agreements (smart contracts).</p>

                                                            <li>First, you need to download and install a cryptocurrency wallet that supports ada.</li>
                                                            <li>Create a new wallet and name it.</li>
                                                            <li>Then, activate your new wallet and ensure to write down your new passwords. Note that your passwords are the only way you can access your wallet; keep them in a safe place and donâ€™t lose them. You will have a spending password (which is the one used for transacting), and a 12- or 24-word passphrase depending on the wallet you chose.</li>
                                                            <li>Recreate your passphrase and accept the terms and conditions. The wallet should be now all set.</li>
                                                            <li>Click â€˜Receiveâ€™ and copy a wallet address or download a PDF file with the QR code. You will need to use this address to receive your cryptocurrency later.</li>

                                                        <ol>

                                                            <li>Create an account. To create an account, exchanges typically require such personal information as:
                                                                <ul>

                                                            </li>
                                                        </ol>
                                                        <p>We recommend setting up 2FA verification for enhanced security and funds safety. It usually takes from several minutes to several days for an account to be activated. This depends on the chosen exchange.</p>

                                                            <li>Select a Buy/Sell option, which is usually at the top menu.</li>
                                                            <li>Click Buy, enter ADA (Cardano) as the cryptocurrency you wish to purchase.</li>
                                                            <li>Indicate the amount of ada you would like to purchase and select a payment method (whether it is a wire transfer, credit or debit card). Each exchange will offer you available options, please read them carefully and follow the outlined steps.</li>
                                                            <li>Confirm your purchase. You will typically have to confirm it via email and enter the 2FA code (in case you have set it up). You will then receive your ada on the exchange account.</li>
                                                            <li>Withdraw ada to your personal wallet. If this is the first time you are making a withdrawal, try smaller amounts to verify that everything works. Note that it is highly not recommended to store ada (or any other cryptocurrency) on the exchange account. To transfer your ada, choose the â€˜Withdrawâ€™ option, paste your wallet address (the one you copied earlier from your wallet) and submit your transfer.</li>
                                                            <li>Check you have received your funds. Go to your wallet and check the balance. You can also track recent transactions using different explorer tools.</li>
                                                        </ol>
                                                        <p>You can now store ada in your personal wallet, transact between different addresses, receive more ada as payment for services (for example), or delegate it to earn rewards.</p>
